If you use Safari on both a Mac and an iPhone, it is convenient to have
separate "Favorites" bookmark folders on each device.

On iPhone, favorites
appear as a grid of bookmark icons when opening a blank tab, making it easy
to quickly access web sites with one tap. On Mac, favorites appear in the
bookmark bar below the address bar in Safari, and you may want a different
set of bookmarks available here.

To have separate behavior on each platform,
simply create a new bookmark folder for your iOS devices. Then on iOS, go
to Settings --> Safari --> Favorites and select the new folder. Put your
favorites for iOS here, and on Mac, the "Favorites" folder will continue
to hold the links that Safari shows in the bookmark bar.
