# Amish Baked Oatmeal (Single Batch)

A favorite of my kids' for many years, this recipe is foolproof and easily
adaptable to what you have on hand. It is not sensitive to moisture or
ingredient substitution. For example, you can substitute granulated sugar for
brown sugar without an adverse effect. You can substitute an alternative milk
for the default cow's milk, too.

## Equipment
  - 1.5&nbsp;L / 6-cup baking dish
  - Measuring spoons
  - Whisk
  - Non-stick spray
