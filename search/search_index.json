USB PD allows a much wider range of charging voltages, currents, and overall higher wattages than before.

Additionally, the maximum achievable input power is often only obtained when the target devices SoC (State of Charge) is between 20% and 60%. Measuring the maximum input wattages thus requires draining the device battery to approximately 20% reported state of charge, allowing all components (charger, device, etc.) to stabilze at room temperature, and then connecting chargers and waiting for the maximum power to be measured before the device state of charge rises too high.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2022/09/22/apple-device-charging-speeds/#a-note-on-charger-voltage-and-current","title":"A Note on Charger Voltage and Current","text":"<p>People frequently ask about compatibility between chargers and devices, especially with respect to stated currents and voltages. In the case of USB chargers, if the cable fits and all components (e.g., device, charger, cable) are high-quality and not defective, connecting them shoule be safe. You may not always get the fastest charging speeds, but you are unlikely to damage any of your devices.

I use a capable 65\u00a0W PPS charger with a maximum output voltage of 20\u00a0V and compatible USB-C cables to generate the results. The \"Max Wattage\" column generalizes the results into common marketing wattage ratings. For example, even though I measured 9V and 2.5A instantaneously for the first row, I report 20 Watts and not 22.5 Watts because 22.5\u00a0W is not a typical marketing bin for USB PD chargers. The intended conclusion is that connecting a 20\u00a0W USB PD charger to that configuration will result in the best charging performance for that configuration.</p> Device Configuration Max Voltage Max Current Max Wattage iPad Air Magic Keybaord 9 V 2.5 A 20 W iPad Air USB-C port 15 V 2 A 30 W iPhone XS Naked 9 V 2 A 18 W iPhone XS Charging Case 15 V 2 A 30 W iPhone 11 Pro Naked 9 V 2 A 18 W iPhone 11 Pro Charging Case 15 V 2 A 30 W"},{"location":"blog/2022/09/22/apple-device-charging-speeds/#ipad","title":"iPad","text":""},{"location":"blog/2022/09/22/apple-device-charging-speeds/#ipad-air-5th-generation","title":"iPad Air 5th Generation","text":"<p>Max Charging Voltage: 15\u00a0V   Max Charging Current: 2\u00a0A   </p> <p>All other factors not considered, a 30\u00a0W USB PD charger and compatible USB-C charging cable will give the best performance for a fifth-generation iPad Air.</p> <p>One interesting observation about charging the iPad Air 5th Gen. is that there is a very long (over 60 seconds) ramp-up time before the device achieves its maximum charging wattage.

After being off work for the Thanksgiving break like many U.S. persons, I picked up my work phone (yes, I'm one of the weirdos that carries around two iPhones because Corporate Reasons) and noticed that it was not connected to WiFi, and it prompted me to re-enter my passcode instead of unlocking with Face ID because the iPhone had rebooted.</p> <p>I am sure that I heard about this feature in the run-up to and time immediately after the release of iOS 18, but I never paid it much attention and forgot about it. This was one of the rare extended weekends where I didn't feel compelled to check my phone at all. It's a little strange to not have the phone always connected to WiFi, and I'm sure there's some good security reason for limiting the phone to cellular data before it is unlocked for the first time after booting up, but I wasn't particularly pleased to learn that it was running on cellular only for a few days.</p> <p>The notable exception I've noticed to iPhones not reconnecting to WiFi after a restart is when installing iOS updates. After the phone installs the update and reboots, it will reconnect to WiFi if it was connected to WiFi during the update.</p> <p>Update to note that the apparent reason that the iPhone does not connect to WiFi before the first unlock is because the WiFi passwords are stored in the keychain, and the keychain is not unlocked before the user enters their passcode for the first time.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/12/10/iphone-youtube-videos-from-2009-2012/","title":"iPhone YouTube Videos from 2009-2012","text":"<p>From Riley Walz</p> <p>A cool website that shows iPhone videos from 2009 - 2012 that were uploaded to YouTube with the built-in \"Send to YouTube\" button in the Photos app.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/01/09/yours-truly-on-daring-fireball/","title":"Yours Truly on Daring Fireball","text":"<p>A very late update, but I am somewhat proud to have made it to the DF front page back in April 2024.
