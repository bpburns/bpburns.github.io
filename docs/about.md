## About Me

### My Name

My name is Brian Barefoot Burns. No, it's not a Native American name.
No, "Barefoot" is not my nickname, and it does not belong in quotes between
"Brian" and "Burns."
My unmarried name is Burns. My wife's maiden name is Barefoot. When we got
married, she didn't want to completely give up her cool last name. We also
decided that if we had children, we wanted every member
of the family to share the same last name.

Our marriage license was issued in Multnomah County, Oregon. One of the
prescribed options for us from the county was to combine our unmarried last
names into a new, two-word last name, which we chose. In hindsight, it might
have caused less confusion for everyone if we had chosen the hyphenated option,
but here we are. We now have three children, all named Barefoot Burns.

### Personal Life

I was born in Oregon City, OR and grew up in Vancouver, WA (no, not Vancouver,
B.C.). After graduating from college and working for a year in the Portland, OR
area, I moved to San Diego, CA.

I met my future wife in college, and we were married on the campus of our alma
mater. We lived together in San Diego for two years before moving to Phoenix,
AZ. We currently live in the Phoenix area with our two children.

### Education

I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Shiley School of
Engineering at the University of Portland (no, not Portland State University).
I am a software engineer by education, training, and experience.

### Work

I am a Senior Software Engineer at a large enterprise company in the satellite
industry. My work comprises Big Data stuff, e.g. Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, and
related technologies. I also build and maintain back-office software systems
and am experienced maintaining and re-engineering legacy software. My team
works on exciting things like Internet service on business jets and military
aircraft.

I primarily work in Python, Scala, and Java. I have extensive experience
maintaining and developing for \*NIX systems.

Before my current job, I worked for a small test engineering laboratory in
Hillsboro, OR. The bulk of my work there was contract engineering at a large
blue-chip semiconductor manufacturer in that area.

In high school and during college, I worked for a large department store for a
total of seven years before graduating college and pursuing my career path. I
would have enjoyed staying with the same company and working in their extensive
robotics development endeavors, but that did not pan out.
