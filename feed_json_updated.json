USB PD allows a much wider range of charging\nvoltages, currents, and overall higher wattages than before. This makes\nUSB PD suitable for powering and charging especially power-hungry\ndevices like laptops and tablets that support USB PD.</p>\n<h2 id=\"overview\">Overview</h2>\n<p>This article provides a guide on achieving the highest charging speeds\nand fastest charging times for different Apple devices.</p>\n<p>Unforunately, the maximum input power specifications for devices can be\ndifficult or impossible to find on Apple products and must be measured\nand confirmed. Additionally, the maximum achievable input power is\noften only obtained when the target devices SoC (State of Charge) is\nbetween 20% and 60%. Measuring the maximum input wattages thus requires\ndraining the device battery to approximately 20% reported state of\ncharge, allowing all components (charger, device, etc.) to stabilze at\nroom temperature, and then connecting chargers and waiting for the\nmaximum power to be measured before the device state of charge rises\ntoo high.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-note-on-charger-voltage-and-current\">A Note on Charger Voltage and Current</h2>\n<p>People frequently ask about compatibility between chargers and devices,\nespecially with respect to stated currents and voltages. In the case of\nUSB chargers, if the cable fits and all components (e.g., device,\ncharger, cable) are high-quality and not defective, connecting them\nshoule be safe. You may not always get the fastest charging speeds,\nbut you are unlikely to damage any of your devices. USB devices and\nchargers negotiate their operating voltages and currents.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Can I use a 2&nbsp;A charger to charge a device that states it needs\n  1&nbsp;A of current? <br />\n  Yes. The device will only draw 1&nbsp;A of current from the charger.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Can I use a 1&nbsp;A charger to charge a device that states it needs\n  2&nbsp;A of input? <br />\n  Yes. The device may charge more slowly, but the configuration should\n  be safe. Some devices will warn you if they cannot operate because\n  the connected charger is not supplying enough current.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"devices\">Devices</h2>\n<p>The table below shows the maximum approximate input power parameters I\nhave measured on various devices. I use a capable 65&nbsp;W PPS charger with\na maximum output voltage of 20&nbsp;V and compatible USB-C cables to generate\nthe results. The \"Max Wattage\" column generalizes the results into\ncommon marketing wattage ratings. For example, even though I measured\n9V and 2.5A instantaneously for the first row, I report 20 Watts and\nnot 22.5 Watts because 22.5&nbsp;W is not a typical marketing bin for USB PD\nchargers. The intended conclusion is that connecting a 20&nbsp;W USB PD\ncharger to that configuration will result in the best charging\nperformance for that configuration.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Device</th>\n<th>Configuration</th>\n<th>Max Voltage</th>\n<th>Max Current</th>\n<th>Max Wattage</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>iPad Air</td>\n<td>Magic Keybaord</td>\n<td>9 V</td>\n<td>2.5 A</td>\n<td>20 W</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>iPad Air</td>\n<td>USB-C port</td>\n<td>15 V</td>\n<td>2 A</td>\n<td>30 W</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>iPhone XS</td>\n<td>Naked</td>\n<td>9 V</td>\n<td>2 A</td>\n<td>18 W</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>iPhone XS</td>\n<td>Charging Case</td>\n<td>15 V</td>\n<td>2 A</td>\n<td>30 W</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>iPhone 11 Pro</td>\n<td>Naked</td>\n<td>9 V</td>\n<td>2 A</td>\n<td>18 W</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>iPhone 11 Pro</td>\n<td>Charging Case</td>\n<td>15 V</td>\n<td>2 A</td>\n<td>30 W</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 id=\"ipad\">iPad</h3>\n<h4 id=\"ipad-air-5th-generation\">iPad Air 5th Generation</h4>\n<p>Max Charging Voltage: 15&nbsp;V  <br />\nMax Charging Current: 2&nbsp;A   </p>\n<p>All other factors not considered, a 30&nbsp;W USB PD charger and compatible\nUSB-C charging cable will give the best performance for a\nfifth-generation iPad Air.</p>\n<p>One interesting observation about charging the iPad Air 5th Gen. is\nthat there is a very long (over 60 seconds) ramp-up time before the\ndevice achieves its maximum charging wattage. The device slowly\nrequests higher voltages and draws increasing current from the\nconnected charger until it tops out based on the individual\nconfigurations listed below. This is different from what I have\ngenerally observed in iPhones and various laptops, where the device\nquickly negotiates the highest voltage supported by both charger and\ndevice and then quickly ramps up its current draw to achieve its\nmaximum charging wattage.</p>\n<p>If you're in a pinch and need a lot of power quickly, use a 30&nbsp;W USB PD\ncharger and connect it directly to the iPad's USB-C port and not the\nMagic Keyboard's USB-C port (if you're using the Magic Keyboard).</p>\n<h5 id=\"ipad-air-with-magic-keybaord\">iPad Air with Magic Keybaord</h5>\n<p>Max Charging Voltage: 9&nbsp;V <br />\nMax Charging Current: 2&nbsp;A   </p>\n<p>A fifth-generation iPad Air in Apple's Magic Keyboard case, charging\nthrough the Magic Keyboard's USB-C port, tops out at 9V and\napproximately 2.5A, for a generic charging speed of 20&nbsp;W. Therefore,\nselecting a 20&nbsp;W USB PD charger with a maximum voltage of 9V and 2A will\ngenerally give the best charging performance for this iPad Air\nconfiguration.</p>\n<p>If you want faster charging, use the iPad's built-in USB-C port and\na 30&nbsp;W charger and USB-C cable.</p>\n<h5 id=\"ipad-air-without-magic-keyboard\">iPad Air without Magic Keyboard</h5>\n<p>Max Charging Voltage: 15&nbsp;V <br />\nMax Charging Current: 2&nbsp;A</p>\n<p>Without the Magic Keyboard, or by connecting a USB PD charger directly\nto the fifth-gen. iPad Air's USB-C port, you can get up to 30&nbsp;W charging\nby using a USB PD charger with at least 15V max.</p>\n<h3 id=\"iphone\">iPhone</h3>\n<h4 id=\"iphone-xs\">iPhone XS</h4>\n<p>Max Charging Voltage:  15&nbsp;V  <br />\nMax Charging Current:  2&nbsp;A</p>\n<p>To get the fastest charge with this device, charge it with a 30W USB PD charger\nin the Smart Battery Case.

After being off work for\nthe Thanksgiving break like many U.S. persons, I picked up my work\nphone (yes, I'm one of the weirdos that carries around two iPhones\nbecause Corporate Reasons) and noticed that it was not connected to\nWiFi, and it prompted me to re-enter my passcode instead of unlocking\nwith Face ID because the iPhone had rebooted.</p>\n<p>I am sure that I heard about this feature in the run-up to and time\nimmediately after the release of iOS 18, but I never paid it much\nattention and forgot about it. This was one of the rare extended\nweekends where I didn't feel compelled to check my phone at all. It's a\nlittle strange to not have the phone always connected to WiFi, and I'm\nsure there's some good security reason for limiting the phone to\ncellular data before it is unlocked for the first time after booting\nup, but I wasn't particularly pleased to learn that it was running on\ncellular only for a few days.</p>\n<p>The notable exception I've noticed to iPhones not reconnecting to WiFi\nafter a restart is when installing iOS updates. After the phone\ninstalls the update and reboots, it will reconnect to WiFi if it was\nconnected to WiFi during the update.</p>\n<p>Update to note that the apparent reason that the iPhone does not\nconnect to WiFi before the first unlock is because the WiFi passwords\nare stored in the keychain, and the keychain is not unlocked before the\nuser enters their passcode for the first time.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-02-26T12:14:44-07:00", "authors": [], "tags": []}, {"id": "https://bpburns.github.io/blog/2024/12/10/iphone-youtube-videos-from-2009-2012/", "url": "https://bpburns.github.io/blog/2024/12/10/iphone-youtube-videos-from-2009-2012/", "title": "iPhone YouTube Videos from 2009-2012", "content_html": "<h1 id=\"iphone-youtube-videos-from-2009-2012\">iPhone YouTube Videos from 2009-2012</h1>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://walzr.com/IMG_0001\">Riley Walz</a></p>\n<p>A cool website that shows iPhone videos from 2009 - 2012 that were uploaded to\nYouTube with the built-in \"Send to YouTube\" button in the Photos app.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-02-26T12:14:44-07:00", "authors": [], "tags": []}, {"id": "https://bpburns.github.io/blog/2025/01/09/yours-truly-on-daring-fireball/", "url": "https://bpburns.github.io/blog/2025/01/09/yours-truly-on-daring-fireball/", "title": "Yours Truly on Daring Fireball", "content_html": "<h1 id=\"yours-truly-on-daring-fireball\">Yours Truly on Daring Fireball</h1>\n<p>A very late update, but I am somewhat proud to have made it to the DF\nfront page back in April 2024. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/25/more-on-keycap-shine\">Link</a></p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-02-26T12:14:44-07:00", "authors": [], "tags": []}, {"id": "https://bpburns.github.io/blog/2022/09/01/new-material-for-mkdocs-blog/", "url": "https://bpburns.github.io/blog/2022/09/01/new-material-for-mkdocs-blog/", "title": "New Material for MkDocs blog", "content_html": "<h1 id=\"new-material-for-mkdocs-blog\">New Material for MkDocs blog</h1>\n<p>I spend more time fiddling with static site generators than I do actually\nwriting.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-02-26T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": []}]}
